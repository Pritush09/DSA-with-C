Comparisons for th sorting algos are done on the baisis of the following
-> Number of Comparisions
-> Number of Swaps
-> Adaptive (if the array is already sorted then it is able to recognise it or not )
-> Stable (if 2 or 3 elements are same then the first occurance of the element should come first )
-> Extra memory or not
